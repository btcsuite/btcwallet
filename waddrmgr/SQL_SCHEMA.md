# WAddrmgr SQL Schema

This document defines the schema design for the wallet address manager.

### Overview

The schema follows a hierarchical structure with proper foreign key relationships:

```
wallets (1:N) key_scopes (1:N) accounts (1:N) addresses
   |             |               |               |
   |             |               |               |-- address_secrets (1:1)
   |             |               |
   |             |               |-- account_secrets (1:1)
   |             |
   |             |-- key_scope_secrets (1:1)
   |
   |-- wallet_secrets (1:1)
   |
   |-- wallet_sync_states (1:1)

blocks
   |
   |-- Referenced by: wallet_sync_states, addresses

account_origins
   |
   |-- Referenced by: accounts

address_types
   |
   |-- Referenced by: key_scopes (internal_type_id, external_type_id), addresses

address_sync_statuses
   |
   |-- Referenced by: addresses
```

This structure ensures that:

- Each wallet can have multiple key scopes (BIP44, BIP49, BIP84, etc...)
- Each key scope can contain multiple accounts
- Each account can manage multiple addresses (HD-derived, imported addresses)
- Sensitive data is separated into dedicated tables with 1:1 relationships
- Block data is normalized in a separate table to eliminate redundancy and
   ensure consistency

### KVDB to SQL Mapping
The migration process transforms the hierarchical KVDB bucket structure into
normalized relational tables:

```
KVDB Bucket Structure       SQL Table Equivalent
|-- main/                   -> wallets
    |-- (encrypted keys)    -> wallet_secrets (FK: wallet_id)
|-- sync/                   -> wallet_sync_states (FK: wallet_id)
|-- scope-schema/           -> key_scopes (FK: wallet_id)  
|-- scope/<purpose>-<coin>/ -> key_scopes (FK: wallet_id)
    |-- meta/               -> key_scopes (metadata)
    |-- (encrypted keys)    -> key_scope_secrets (FK: scope_id)
    |-- acct/               -> accounts (FK: scope_id)
        |-- (encrypted keys)-> account_secrets (FK: account_id)
    |-- addr/               -> addresses (FK: account_id)
        |-- (secrets)       -> address_secrets (FK: address_id)
    |-- indexes/            -> SQL Indexes
    |-- usedaddrs/          -> addresses.first_seen_height (FK: blocks.height)
```

### SQL Schema reference

To be used as a reference for implementing the migrations, here is the
