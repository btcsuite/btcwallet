# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record) for the `btcwallet` project. ADRs are short, focused documents that capture significant architectural decisions, their context, the options considered, and their consequences.

ADRs serve as a historical log of important design choices, providing context for future development and helping new contributors understand the rationale behind the system's architecture.
