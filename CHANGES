User visible changes for btcwallet
  A wallet daemon for btcd, written in Go
============================================================================

Changes in 0.4.0 (Sun May 25 2014)
  - Implement the following standard bitcoin server RPC requests:
    - signmessage (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/58)
    - verifymessage (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/61)
    - listunspent (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/54)
    - validateaddress (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/60)
    - addressmultisig (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/37)
    - createmultisig (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/37)
    - signrawtransaction (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/59)

  - Add authenticate extension RPC request to authenticate a websocket
    session without requiring the use of the HTTP Authorization header

  - Add btcdusername and btcdpassword options to allow separate
    authentication credentials from wallet clients when authenticating to a
    btcd websocket RPC server

  - Fix RPC response passthrough: JSON unmarshaling and marshaling is now
    delayed until necessary and JSON result objects from btcd are sent to
    clients directly without an extra decode+encode that may change the
    representation of large integer values

  - Fix several websocket client connection issues:
    - Disconnect clients are cleanly removed without hanging on any final
      sends
    - Set deadline for websocket client sends to prevent hanging on
      misbehaving clients or clients with a bad connection

  - Fix return result for dumprivkey by always padding the private key bytes
    to a length of 32

  - Fix rescan for transaction history for imported addresses
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/74)

  - Fix listsinceblock request handler to consider the minimum confirmation
    parameter (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/80)

  - Fix several RPC handlers which require an unlocked wallet to check
    for an unlocked wallet before continuing
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/65)

  - Fix handling for block rewards (coinbase transactions):
    - Update listtransactions results to use "generate" category for
      coinbase outputs
    - Prevent inclusion of immature coinbase outputs for newly created
      transactions

  - Rewrite the transaction store to handle several issues regarding
    transation malleability and performance issues
    - The new transaction store is written to disk in a different format
      then before, and upgrades will require a rescan to rebuild the
      transaction history

  - Improve rescan:
    - Begin rescan with known UTXO set at start height
    - Serialize executation of all rescan requests
    - Merge waiting rescan jobs so all jobs can be handled with a single
      rescan
    - Support parially synced addresses in the keystore and incrementally
      mark rescan progress.  If a rescan is unable to continue (wallet 
      closes, btcd disconnects, etc.) a new rescan can start at the last
      synced chain height

  - Notify (with an unsolicited notification) websocket clients of btcd
    connection state

  - Improve logging:
    - Log reason for disconnecting a websocket client

  - Updates for btcd websocket API changes

  - Stability fixes, internal API changes, general code cleanup, and comment
    corrections

Changes in 0.3.0 (Mon Feb 10 2014)
  - Use correct hash algorithm for chained addresses (fixes a bug where
    address chaining was still deterministic, but forked from Armory and
    previous btcwallet implementations)

  - Change websocket endpoint to connect to btcd 0.6.0-alpha

  - Redo server implementation to serialize handling of client requests

  - Redo account locking to greatly reduce btcwallet lockups caused by
    incorrect mutex usage

  - Open all accounts, rather than just the default account, at startup

  - Generate new addresses using pubkey chaining if keypool is depleted and
    wallet is locked

  - Make maximum keypool size a configuration option (keypoolsize)

  - Add disallowfree configuration option (default false) to force adding
    the minimum fee to all outbound transactions

  - Implement the following standard bitcoin server RPC requests:
    - getinfo (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/63)
    - getrawchangeaddress (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/41)
    - getreceivedbyaccount (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/42)
    - gettransaction (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/44)
    - keypoolrefill (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/48)
    - listsinceblock (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/52)
    - sendtoaddress (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/56)

  - Add empty (unimplemented) handlers for the following RPC requests so
    requests are not passed down to btcd:
    - getblocktemplate
    - getwork
    - stop

  - Add RPC extension request, exportwatchingwallet, to export an account
    with a watching-only wallet from an account with a hot wallet that
    may be used by a separate btcwallet instance

  - Require all account wallets to share the same passphrase

  - Change walletlock and walletpassphrase RPC requests to lock or unlock
    all account wallets

  - Allow opening accounts with watching-only wallets

  - Return txid for sendfrom RPC requests
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/64)

  - Rescan imported private keys in background
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/34)

  - Do not import duplicate private keys
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/35)

  - Write all three account files for a new account, rather than just
    the wallet (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/30)

  - Create any missing directories before writing autogenerated certificate
    pair

  - Fix rescanning of a new account's root address

  - Fix error in the wallet file serialization causing duplicate address
    encryption attempts

  - Fix issue calculating eligible transaction inputs caused by a bad
    confirmation check

  - Fix file locking issue on Windows caused by not closing files before
    renaming

  - Fix typos in README file

Changes in 0.2.1 (Thu Jan 10 2014)
  - Fix a mutex issue which caused btcwallet to lockup on all
    RPC requests needing to read or write an account

Changes in 0.2.0 (Thu Jan 09 2014)
  - Enable mainnet support (disabled by default, use --mainnet to enable)

  - Don't hardcode localhost btcd connections.  Instead, add a --connect
    option to specify the hostname or address and port of a local or
    remote btcd instance
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/1)

  - Remove --serverport port and replace with --listen.  This option works
    just like btcd's --rpclisten  and allows to specify the interfaces to
    listen for RPC connections

  - Require TLS and Basic HTTP authentication before wallet can be
    controlled over RPC

  - Refill keypool if wallet is unlocked and keypool is emptied

  - Detect and rollback saved tx/utxo info after btcd performs blockchain
    reorganizations while btcwallet was disconnected

  - Add support for the following standard bitcoin JSON-RPC calls:
    - dumpprivkey (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/9)
    - getaccount
    - getaccountaddress
    - importprivkey (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/2)
    - listtransactions (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/12)

  - Add several extension RPC calls for websocket connections:
    - getaddressbalance: get the balance associated with a single address
    - getunconfirmedbalance: get total balance for unconfirmed transactions
    - listaddresstransactions: list transactions for a single address
      (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/27)
    - listalltransactions: lists all transactions without specifying a range

  - Make RPC extensions available only to websocket connections, with the
    exception of createencryptedwallet

  - Add dummy handlers for unimplemented wallet RPC calls
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/29)

  - Add socks5/tor proxy support

  - Calculate and add minimum transaction fee to created transactions

  - Use OS-specific rename calls to provide atomic file renames which
    can replace a currently-existing file
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/20)

  - Move account files to a single directory per bitcoin network to
    prevent a future scaling issue
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/16)

  - Fix several data races and mutex mishandling

  - Fix a bug where the RPC server hung on requests requiring btcd
    when a btcd connection was never established

  - Fix a bug where creating account files did not create all necessary
    directories (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/15)

  - Fix a bug where '~' did not expand to a home or user directory
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/17)
