# Wallet Package Architecture

The `wallet` package serves as the high-level orchestrator for all core wallet functionality. It integrates key management (`waddrmgr`), transaction management (`wtxmgr`), and blockchain interaction (`chain`) to provide a unified, high-level API for wallet operations.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **High-Level Wallet API**: Expose a clean, intuitive, and stable API for common wallet operations through a set of small, role-based interfaces.
2.  **Orchestration**: Coordinate the complex interactions between the address manager, the transaction store, and the blockchain backend.
3.  **State Management**: Manage the wallet's state, including its lock status and synchronization with the blockchain, in a robust and concurrency-safe manner.
4.  **Decoupling from Storage**: Ensure that the wallet's business logic is completely independent of the underlying database technology.

## Architectural Design: The `Wallet` Actor

Following the project's core philosophy, the `Wallet` is designed as an **actor**â€”a self-contained, concurrent unit that manages its own state and communicates via messages.

-   **State Ownership**: The `Wallet` actor is the sole owner of the `waddrmgr.Manager` and `wtxmgr.Store` instances. All access to these critical components **MUST** go through the `Wallet` actor's API. This serializes all state-mutating operations, ensuring data consistency without the need for complex, fine-grained locking.
-   **Command Processing**: The public methods of the `Wallet` will not perform complex logic directly. Instead, they will send a command message to the actor's internal message loop (its "mailbox") and wait for a response. This ensures that all operations are processed sequentially and safely.

## Decoupling from the Database via the Repository Pattern

A critical architectural goal is to decouple the wallet's logic from the specifics of the database backend. This is essential for achieving the goal of migrating to a SQL database.

-   **The `Store` Interface**: We will define a `Store` (or `Repository`) interface that abstracts all database operations required by `waddrmgr` and `wtxmgr`. This interface will be designed with a relational model in mind, featuring methods like `CreateTransaction`, `GetAddress`, `ListUnspentOutputs`, etc., rather than low-level `Get`/`Put` calls.
-   **Interface-Based Logic**: The `Wallet` actor and its components (`waddrmgr`, `wtxmgr`) will be refactored to depend *only* on this `Store` interface, not on `walletdb` directly.
-   **Concrete Implementations**: We will provide two concrete implementations of the `Store` interface:
    1.  **`KVStore`**: An implementation that adapts the existing `walletdb` (BoltDB) backend to the new interface.
    2.  **`SQLStore`**: The new implementation that uses a SQL database as its backend.

## Interface-Driven Design: Role-Based Interfaces

The `wallet` package exposes a set of small, role-based interfaces based on the domain objects they manage. This adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle and the Single Responsibility Principle, making the API safer, more modular, and easier to consume. A single concrete `Wallet` struct will implement all of these interfaces, but consumers of the package should depend only on the narrowest interface they need.

    // sensitive key material.
    PrivKeyForAddress(ctx context.Context, a btcutil.Address) (*btcec.PrivateKey, error)
}
```

## Chain and Notification Architecture

The wallet's interaction with the blockchain is managed by a new two-tiered architecture that separates low-level, stateless I/O from high-level, stateful notification management. This is composed of the `chain` and `ntfn` packages, which are detailed in their respective `ARCHITECTURE.md` files.

## Key Architectural Decisions

The new architecture is guided by several key decisions:

-   **Hybrid "Push" Notification Model**: The system is primarily asynchronous, with the `ntfn.Notifier` pushing events to clients. However, registration methods provide an immediate, synchronous check of the notifier's current state to support linear client workflows.

-   **"Subscribe-First, Sync-Later" Startup**: To eliminate race conditions, all subsystems must subscribe to the `ntfn.Notifier` *before* the `chain.Driver` is started and begins processing blocks.

-   **Dependency Inversion for Drivers**: The low-level `chain.Driver` depends on a `ChainEventReceiver` interface, which is implemented by the high-level `ntfn.Notifier`. This creates a clean, decoupled boundary.

-   **Stateless and Opaque Drivers**: All `chain.Driver` implementations must be stateless, with all stateful logic (queues, reorg tracking) pushed up to the `ntfn` layer. They must also encapsulate backend-specific complexity and return a standard set of typed, exported errors.
